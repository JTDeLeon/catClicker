# Cat Clicker

This application is built with MOV (Model Octopus View) based strictly in Vanilla JS.

## Usage:
To use this application begin by opening the index.html file and you will be able to click on the various cat names listed.

This will open up your cat that you can click on.

Each time you click on the cat, the counter will increment.

## Admins:
If you want to administrate the application by changing the cat name, cat picture source, or the cat counter number, click on the admin button and complete the form within the application.
